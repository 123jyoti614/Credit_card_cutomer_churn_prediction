# Credit_card_cutomer_churn_prediction
This project aims to predict whether a credit card customer will churn (i.e., stop using the service) using various machine learning techniques. Customer churn is a major challenge for the banking and financial sectors, and early identification of potential churners helps improve customer retention strategies.
